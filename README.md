TCG runs on https://click-21ny.onrender.com/

It need to be deployed before every use because its the free version. You can either make your own render.com site and link it to the github, build and run it that way, or I currently have auto deploy on so it *should* build the site every time there is a commit. (You could add/remove a comment at the end of the main file or something), commit, and it should be deployed between 1-5 minutes. Keep in mind right now there seems to be an issue with the finalcleanup either on front or backend so you can only press start game once before it breaks, need to redeploy the site
